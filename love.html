<p>My journal in English; I chose chapter 1 (The Great Gatsby).</p>
<p>Summary of chapter 1:</p>
<p>The narrator of the story is Nick Carraway. He's from Minnesota and casts himself in the story. Nick is a non-judgmental person. He arrives in New York and rents a house in a part of Long Island called West Egg, which is home to rich people. He doesn't like his neighbor. One night, while having dinner with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom, Nick sees Gatsby for the first time, and he is an elegant man. This is the summary of The Great Gatsby, Chapter 1.</p>

<p>Reflection (Lesson 4): System allocation. We have prototypes, traditional, command, and market systems. Teacher Maj discussed the differences between effectively and efficiently. Effectively means functioning well, while efficiently refers to making the best use of limited resources.</p>
